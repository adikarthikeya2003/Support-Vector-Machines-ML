# Support-Vector-Machines-ML

This repository contains an implementation of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm, a powerful supervised learning technique for classification and regression tasks.

## Features

Implementation of SVM for binary and multi-class classification.

Kernel functions supported: Linear, Polynomial, RBF (Gaussian), and more.

Optimization using techniques like the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO).

Visualization of decision boundaries and support vectors (if applicable).

Includes sample datasets for demonstration and testing.

## Technologies Used:

Python

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (optional, for comparisons or utilities)

## Applications:

Classification tasks like handwriting recognition and sentiment analysis.

Regression tasks using Support Vector Regression (SVR).

Understanding hyperplanes, margins, and kernel methods in machine learning.
